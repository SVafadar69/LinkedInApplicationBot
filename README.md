# LinkedInApplicationBot

Automated Job Application Bot using Python, Selenium, and Beautiful Soup. 

The Bot auto applies to linkedin easy applications for you. Simple replace the website url in main with the searched term ("Business Analyst", "quant developer", etc.) URL
of the job you would like to apply for, and the bot will begin the auto-application process for you. Currently, it will only submit applications to easy apply listings that can 
be submitted instantly. Future iterations will involve the release of dynamic try-catching, that will automate the entire application process, and create a csv
file of all non easy apply jobs, so you can later save those jobs to apply to them.
